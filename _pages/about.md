I think you can tell a lot about me by my diving journey.

I'm not a great swimmer. Therefore, before starting university, it seemed like a great idea to work in a factory for a year so I could afford to spend six weeks scuba diving off a tropical island.

So, at 18, I paid the money I'd saved, packed a rucksack that was almost bigger than me, and got on a plane to Indonesia.

I became a PADI qualified rescue diver (after obtaining my open water and advanced open water qualifications). I failed my first attempt after not locating the missing diver, and narrowly avoided being rescued on my second attempt after one fin fell off and I had to swim against a current to get back to shore while carrying an extra set of diving gear. Honestly, don't expect me to rescue you in anything larger than a pond.

I wasn't a natural diver. I struggled with every aspect of it.

I bloody loved it.

I bring this attitude to everything else I have tackled in my life. My studies, my jobs - I will throw myself into it with a smile on my face. I believe you can learn anything and do anything with the right attitude and, more importantly, the right people around you.
